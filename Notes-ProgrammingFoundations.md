# Programming Foundations Notes

## Object Oriented Design 

The four fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming mentioned in the video are:

- **Abstraction:** Focusing on the essential qualities of something rather than specific examples.
- **Polymorphism:** Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes based on existing ones to promote code reuse.
- **Encapsulation:** Restricting access to certain components and only exposing necessary parts.

These concepts are often remembered with the acronym A-P-I-E.

The steps involved in object-oriented analysis and design, as described in the video "Analysis, design, and programming," are:

- **Gathering Requirements:** Determine what the application needs to do by fully understanding the problem you're trying to solve.
- **Describing the Application:** Build a narrative in plain, conversational language for how people will use the application.
- **Identifying Objects:** Identify the most important objects, which is the starting point for identifying actual classes.
- **Describing Interactions:** Formally describe the interactions between objects, understanding each object's responsibilities and behaviors.
- **Creating a Class Diagram:** Develop a visual representation of the classes in the application, where object-oriented principles like inheritance and polymorphism come into play.

These steps help in creating a conceptual design that can be used to build the solution.
